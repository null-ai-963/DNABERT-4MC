# DNABERT-4MC
This project provides core code for predicting DNA N-4 methylation sites. As you can see, the project contains seven py files and two folders. The main points are:

The models.py file displays the construction status of our final model.

Datapreprocessing_ The train.py file shows how we handle the source training dataset.(Contains unknown base filtering scripts)

Datapreprocessing_ The test.py file shows how we handle the source test dataset.(Sample balanced independent test set)

The Datasets folder dataset contains the most primitive dataset.

Feature_ The Coding folder contains the encoding method used.

Due to size limitations, the pre trained model DNABert-pruning will be uploaded to huggingface in the future. Stay tuned.
